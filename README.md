# TheCommunityFarm

This RubyGem provides a way to access the contents of various veg boxes from [The Community Farm](https://www.thecommunityfarm.co.uk/) in your Ruby programs. I use it to generate an XML feed of the various boxes which I can then plug into an IFTTT recipe which emails me when the weekly box contents is updated.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'the_community_farm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the_community_farm

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
